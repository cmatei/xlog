- REQUIREMENTS -
----------------
See the INSTALL file for package requirements when you want to compile xlog
yourself.

- HAMLIB SUPPORT -
------------------
If your rig supports data retrieval over the serial line, you should have
a look at the Hamradio Control Libraries (hamlib) project page, at
http://sf.net/projects/hamlib. Xlog can read your rig's frequency, mode
and signal strength.

- TESTING HAMLIB -
------------------
At his point you should probably read your rig's manual, to see how you
should hook up your rig to the serial port. For my kenwood rig, I need
a standard serial cable with two 9-pin connectors. You also need write
permission to the serial port. On my system, this means I need to add
myself to the dialout group, with a command like:

	adduser 'username' dialout

Next, you can test hamlib with rigctl, a binary distributed with hamlib.
See which rigs are supported:

	rigctl --list

Then start rigctl with your model number, e.g. '210' for a kenwood TS-870S,
hooked up to COM2:

	rigctl -r /dev/ttyS1 -m 210

Now you can check out if mode, PTT, frequency, signal strength and power
(all used by xlog) are retrieved. At the 'Rig command:' prompt, type:

	'f': retrieve frequency
	'm': retrieve mode
	't': retrieve PTT (TX/RX mode)
	'l' and then 'STRENGTH': retrieve signal strength (-54=S0 and 0=S9)
	'l' and then 'RFPOWER': retrieve rig power (0.39 = 100 Watts)

The hamlib FAQ at http://hamlib.sf.net/faq.html gives some answers to common
problems. You could also ask around on the hamlib mailing list, see:
