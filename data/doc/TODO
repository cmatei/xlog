TODO ideas from the original author
- xlog-2.0:
* The final 2.0 release will contain only updated maps, bugfixes and
  language updates.

- xlog-2.1:
* Add more rig control, e.g. change bands from within xlog
* Log as a diary (Martin AA6E).
* Open search as a separate log.
* Mass fill of QSL sent field (4Z5ST)

- xlog-2.2:
* eqsl.cc and lotw capabilities 

- xlog-2.3:
* Rotor control from with xlog (Rob, KL7NA/W7)
* Data exchange with xdx
* Mode dependend scoring ?

- xlog-3.0:
* full transition to XDIF or ADIF format

- XDIF support:
* Leigh, WA5ZNU has developed a log format based on XML which is called XDIF.
  This format can save both log / user data and program settings. Being such
  a flexible format it may eventually become the default xlog format. Please
  have a look at www.xdif.org for more information.

- Simple logging protocol:
* Tomi, OH2BNS has initially proposed a kind of protocol to allow more
  information exchange between gmfsk and xlog, e.g. gmfsk could query the log
  so we can fill in the gmfsk fields while typing the callsign. The latest idea
  is to use a http port for this and return the data in xml format. When we do
  this, we could even use a web-browser for log querying. We would require a
  html page and a XSLT style sheet to display the results.
