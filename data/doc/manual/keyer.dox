/*!\page keyer Keyer \tableofcontentsThe keyer window, available under the Tools Menu, is a simple interface for cwdaemon. You can program all of the function keys with CW messages and control other aspects such as your speed. \image html xlog-keyer.png Keyer Dialog\section keyer-f1-keys F1 - F12 ShortcutsThe function key buttons labeled F1 - F12 are shortcuts that will send the text in the value field to the cwdaemon when the key is pressed.  Any valid ASCII characters can be entered here, however there are certain characters that have been defined as simple text macros.\subsection keyer-macros Keyer Text Macro DefinitionsThe following strings can be used as macros, and the keyer will replace it with the  indicated value.- % = (Percent) My Callsign- @ = (At Symbol) Other persons callsign- # = (Pound) Number counter- ~ = (Tilde) last exchange messageThe ~ (tilde) macro is used for forwarding the last received message. For example, if we make a contest QSO we send "599ABC" and receive "599XYZ". The next QSO we will send "599XYZ" using the ~ macro. This macro would typically be used in the keyer window and defaults dialog. The initial message can be set in page 2 of the preferences dialog.\subsection keyer-defaults Keyer Defaults- F1 : cq de % % test- F2 : @ de %- F3 : @ ++5nn-#- F4 : tu 73- F5 : @- F6 : %- F7 : @ sri qso b4 gl- F8 : agn- F9 : ?- F10 : qrz?- F11 : pse k- F12 : ++++test--% %Words Per minutes (WPM) :  24Count : 1\section keyer-basic-usage Basic UsageClicking the stop button or using the 'ESC' key will abort any current sending messages. You can also see a counter for serial numbers, a toggle box for short serial numbers and a menu for selecting either CQ or "Search Pound" mode.The number counter will auto-increment. The defaults dialog can be used to fill in default reports for a contest, the &#35; and ~ macro can be used in the TX(RST) field of this dialog.\section keyer-contest-modes Contest ModesThe keyer in Xlog can be used in both CQ and SP Contest modes.\subsection contest-cq Running a Contest in CQ Mode-# cursor on the callsign field-# &lt; enter &gt; on an empty callsign field will call &lt; F1 &gt;: "CQ de PG4I PG4I test"-# enter the callsign you hear and hit &lt; enter &gt;-# &lt; F3 &gt; will be sent: "PA0R 5nntt1"-# exchange entries will be filled in from the defaults dialog-# xlog will jump to the end of the exchange field &lt; RX(RST) &gt;-# enter the exchange number you hear and hit &lt; enter &gt;-# xlog will complete the date, time and frequency entries-# the &lt; CQTU &gt; entry will now be sent: "tu PG4I test"-# the QSO will be added to the log-# the counter will be incremented-# all fields will be cleared and xlog will jump to the callsign field\subsection contest-sp Running a Contest in SP Mode-# cursor on the callsign field-# enter the callsign you here and hit &lt; enter &gt;-# &lt; F6 &gt; will be sent: "PG4I"-# exchange entries will be filled in from the defaults dialog-# xlog will jump to the end of the exchange field &lt; RX(RST) &gt;-# fill in the exchange and hit &lt; enter &gt;-# &lt; S&#38;PTU &gt; will be sent: "TU 5nntt1"-# the QSO will be added to the log-# the counter will be incremented-# all fields will be cleared and xlog will jump to the callsign field*/
