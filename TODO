1) When two logs are open, click the 2nd tab and dupe check it.
   The program mistakenly dupe checks the log in the 1st tab.

2) Double check that when all logs is selected, the lists which are created
   should include QSOs from both logs.

Problem: entirelist contains QSOs across multiple pages.
    The index into the entirelist is NOT the correct index into the original list.
