Basic installation instructions for xlog
========================================

  1. The Hamradio Control Libraries will allow you to read the frequency of
     your rig over the serial port. You will need to have both headers and
     development libraries installed in order to compile xlog. You can not
     compile xlog without hamlib support.

  2. You also need a package called pkg-config in order for the configure
     script to work.

  3. pkg-config will look for a file called hamlib.pc. If this file is not
     installed in /usr/lib/pkgconfig, you should tell pkg-config where it is
     by modifying the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH before calling
     configure, e.g:
     PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig".

  4. If you want to update the KDE/Gnome mime database while installing, use 
     ./configure --enable-mime-update. This is recommended if you install xlog
     to /usr or /usr/local.
     
     A note for Linux and *BSD package maintainers: do not use
     --enable-mime-update, instead call update-mime-database and
     update-desktop-database in your installation script at install time.

  5. Xlog needs the gtk+2.0 development libraries to compile. On most 
     distributions the will be called libgtk2.0-dev or -devel. 
     Please use version 2.18.0 or higher.  

This all means you need a fairly recent distribution to compile xlog.
Mandriva 2008, Slackware 12.0, Redhat Fedora Core 8 or Ubuntu 7.10 will all
meet these requirements. Xlog was developed on Debian Unstable.

  6. Type `./configure'.

In case the configure script can not find libintl.h or the intl libraries.
try: ./configure CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib". This
can happen in *BSD systems where libintl is installed into the /usr/local
path and is not included into the C library.

  7. Type `make' to compile the package.

  8. Type `make install' to install the programs and data files. 

  9.  When you want to strip the binary when installing, just type:
     `make install-strip'.

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in 
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man/man1', `/usr/local/share/xlog', etc.  
You can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving 
`configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.
